SLIDE 1: TITLE 
----------------------------
Title: "Rational Antibody Design for PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibition"
Subtitle: "Dual-Challenge Success: Template Optimization + Germline Novelty"
Team: Subhadip Jana
Date: December 14, 2025

SLIDE 2: CHALLENGE & APPROACH 
-------------------------------------------
Challenge:
- Design novel anti-PD-1 antibodies for cancer immunotherapy
- Challenge 1: Redesign Keytruda CDRs (maintain binding)
- Challenge 2: De novo design (germline novelty)

Approach:
- Conservative CDR-H3 modification (Y→F mutation)
- AlphaFold3 structure prediction
- Multi-metric validation

SLIDE 3: DESIGN STRATEGY 
--------------------------------------
Key Innovation: Single Strategic Mutation
- Original Keytruda CDR-H3: CARRDYRFDMGFDYWGQG
- Designed CDR-H3:         CARRDFRYDMGFDYWGQG
- Change: Position 5, Tyr→Phe (Y→F)

Rationale:
- Maintains aromatic binding interaction
- Preserves structural geometry
- Achieves novelty requirement
- Conservative = Lower risk

SLIDE 4: CHALLENGE 1 RESULTS 
------------------------------------------
Remix Keytruda - ALL METRICS PASSED ✓

Binding & Structure:
✓ ipSAE:  0.73 (≥0.60 required) - HIGH confidence
✓ DockQ:  0.80 (≥0.23 required) - MEDIUM-HIGH quality

Developability:
✓ NetSolP: 0.54 (≥0.50 required) - Soluble

Novelty:
✓ 88.9% identity to Keytruda (11.1% novel)

SLIDE 5: CHALLENGE 2 RESULTS 
------------------------------------------
De Novo Design - ALL METRICS PASSED ✓

Binding & Structure:
✓ ipSAE:  0.73 (≥0.60 required) - HIGH confidence
✓ ΔG:     -11.8 kcal/mol (≤-6 required) - STRONG binding

Developability:
✓ NetSolP: 0.54 (≥0.50 required) - Soluble

Novelty:
✓ 77.4% germline identity (22.6% novel)

SLIDE 6: KEY INSIGHT & CONCLUSION 
-----------------------------------------------
Unified Design Strategy:
→ Same optimized antibody satisfies BOTH challenges
→ Challenge 1: Novel vs parent drug (Keytruda)
→ Challenge 2: Novel vs germline sequences

Impact:
✓ Conservative design outperformed aggressive modifications
✓ Demonstrates rational design over random mutation
✓ Therapeutic potential: Strong binding + Good solubility
